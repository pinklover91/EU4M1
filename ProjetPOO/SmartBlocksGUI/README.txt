                      SmartBlocks Graphic User Interface
=========================================================================

This is a graphic interface created with JavaFX technologies, namely
version 1.3.1.

The only aim with this JavaFX project is to show the functionalities of the
small 2D physics engine developed in order to simulate a smart surface.
This engine can be found in the project SmartBlocks, more information in
the respective README file and http://www.smartsurface.cnrs.fr/

In order see how it works, the user should just double-click on the jnlp
launch file: dist/SmartBlocksGUI.jnlp

This is a project generated using Netbeans version 6.9.1. Further versions
of this IDE are not suitable, because JavaFX Script is no longer developed 
nor supported by Netbeans IDEs, as stated by Oracle Corp. in JavaOne 2010.

The new specification of JavaFX (2.0) does not make use of any scripting language
just standard Java code. Unfortunately for the author, the specification was
released just some weeks ago, when the coding had already begun.
